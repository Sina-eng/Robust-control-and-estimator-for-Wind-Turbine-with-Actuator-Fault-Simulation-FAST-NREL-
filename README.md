# Robust-control-and-estimator-for-Wind-Turbine-with-Actuator-Fault-Simulation-FAST-NREL-
This repository contains the SIMULINK model and MATLAB codes corresponding to the closed-loop dynamical model of the wind turbine in the FAST simulator (v.8) as a benchmark system developed by NREL:
A Robust adaptive control is implemented for a wind turbine with actuator faults as a case study using FAST simulator developed by NREL. To illustrate, an L2-gain based controller along with online parameter estimation (least squre with bounded gain forgetting factor), and an automatic control allocation is proposed and implemented and can be adopted to other applications with functional redundency in the low-level layer. 
A paper presenting this technique has been accepted to MECC 2021 conference and its preprint will be avialble on arxiv.
This sourece code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty. We do request that publications in which this method is improved or adopted for other applications, explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing the corresponding paper:
