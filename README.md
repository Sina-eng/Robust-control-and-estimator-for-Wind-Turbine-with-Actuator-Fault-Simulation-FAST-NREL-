Robust adaptive control for wind turbine with actuator faults FAST simulator (NREL)
Implementation of L2-gain controller along with online parameter estimation (least squre with bounded gain forgetting factor), and adaptive control allocation for a wind turbine with actuator fault

This repository contains the MATLAB Simulink correponding to the closed-loop dynamical model of FAST simulator (v.8) by NREL. A paper presenting this technique has been accepted to MECC 2021 conference and its preprint will be avialble on arxiv.

This source code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty. We do request that publications in which this testbed is adopted, explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing the corresponding papers:
